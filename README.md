In the Transparent Proxy Pattern, the upgrade logic or function resides within the proxy contract itself. Conversely, in UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard), the upgrade logic is housed in a separate logic contract, distinct from the proxy. With UUPS, the proxy maintains immutability while connecting to the logic contract via a call, thereby offering enhanced flexibility. This enables alterations to the logic contract without disrupting user access to the proxy contract.
